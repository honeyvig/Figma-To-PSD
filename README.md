# Figma-To-PSD
Converting a Figma file to a PSD (Photoshop Document) format is a complex task that typically requires exporting assets and layers from Figma and then converting them into the PSD format. While there is no direct way to convert a Figma file to PSD through Python libraries, you can achieve this by using a combination of the Figma API and image processing libraries in Python.
Approach:

    Export assets from Figma using the Figma API.
    Manipulate and convert images (exported from Figma) to a PSD file using libraries like Pillow, psd-tools, or psd.py.

Here’s how you can go about it step-by-step:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

You will need the following Python libraries:

    requests to interact with the Figma API.
    psd-tools to create and manipulate PSD files.
    Pillow for image manipulation.

Install the required packages using pip:

pip install requests psd-tools Pillow

Step 2: Set Up the Figma API

To access a Figma design file, you need an API token from Figma and the file ID of the design. You can get this from the Figma file’s URL.

For example, in the Figma link you provided:
https://www.figma.com/design/AT7nRQ50LvZX4ibXJVVMrf/HoodyGang?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas

The file ID is AT7nRQ50LvZX4ibXJVVMrf.

Generate a personal access token from Figma at: Figma Personal Access Tokens
Step 3: Python Code for Figma API Integration

You can use the following code to export images from the Figma file:

import requests
import json
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import psd_tools

# Figma API token and file ID
FIGMA_API_TOKEN = 'your_figma_api_token'
FIGMA_FILE_ID = 'AT7nRQ50LvZX4ibXJVVMrf'

# Figma API URL
BASE_URL = f'https://api.figma.com/v1/files/{FIGMA_FILE_ID}'

# Set up headers for Figma API authentication
headers = {
    'X-Figma-Token': FIGMA_API_TOKEN
}

def fetch_figma_file():
    # Send a GET request to fetch the file data from Figma
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

def export_image_from_figma(node_id):
    export_url = f"https://api.figma.com/v1/images/{FIGMA_FILE_ID}?ids={node_id}&scale=2&format=png"
    response = requests.get(export_url, headers=headers)
    image_url = response.json()['images'][node_id]

    # Fetch the image from the URL
    img_response = requests.get(image_url)
    return img_response.content

def create_psd_from_images(images):
    psd = psd_tools.PSDImage()

    for img in images:
        # Convert each image to PSD layer and add it
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(img))
        image = image.convert("RGBA")
        
        psd_layer = psd_tools.layer.Layer.from_image(image)
        psd.append(psd_layer)

    psd.save('output.psd')

def main():
    # Fetch the Figma file and extract node IDs (or layers)
    figma_data = fetch_figma_file()

    # Assume we want to export images from all nodes, or you can specify node IDs
    node_ids = ['0:1']  # Replace with actual node IDs or layer IDs from Figma file

    images = []
    for node_id in node_ids:
        img_data = export_image_from_figma(node_id)
        images.append(img_data)

    # Convert to PSD and save
    create_psd_from_images(images)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Explanation:

    Fetch the Figma file: The fetch_figma_file function gets the structure of the Figma file using the Figma API.
    Export assets: The export_image_from_figma function fetches an image of a specific node (layer) from the Figma design.
    Create PSD file: The create_psd_from_images function takes the images and converts them into PSD layers using the psd-tools library. The images are processed into RGBA mode to maintain transparency and are saved into a PSD file.

Step 4: How to Run:

    Replace 'your_figma_api_token' with your actual Figma API token.
    Replace 'AT7nRQ50LvZX4ibXJVVMrf' with your actual Figma file ID.
    Specify the node IDs or layer IDs you want to export from Figma.
    Run the script. The script will fetch the design, export the layers as PNGs, and convert them into a PSD file.

Step 5: Limitations

    Direct Conversion: Direct conversion from Figma to PSD is not possible because Figma and Photoshop are two different design ecosystems. This script helps you export images as PNGs and converts them to PSD, but vector properties or advanced design features (like texts, gradients, and layers) will be flattened into a rasterized format.
    Node Selection: You may need to inspect the Figma file structure to get the correct node IDs and organize layers in a meaningful way for the PSD file.
    Complexity: If your design has interactive or complex elements, additional work may be required to replicate them.

This code should serve as a foundational starting point for exporting designs from Figma and creating PSD files. The task of converting designs with high fidelity into Photoshop files will require further refinement and consideration of advanced features in both platforms.
